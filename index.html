<h1> Wake Up! Women</h1>
<p1>We are connecting with you today about our campaign ‘Internships for Women’. This initiative brings internships for those women who are struggling to start or restart working (after a break). With 5000+ paid internships, we aim to enable women in overcoming the hindrances they face in opting a working life and fulfill their desire to work. 

We so far have helped 600 women in joining the workforce. Please find below two inspiring stories of such women who restarted their careers with internships.

Here is an example of Vidya Amar, a homemaker, who restarted her career after taking a break of over a decade for her family in the field of software development.

This is a story of Pallavi Bhaskar, a homemaker, who left her job to live with her husband in the same city and managed her home and work life efficiently by opting for work from home internships.
